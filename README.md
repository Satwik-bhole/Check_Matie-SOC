âœ… What I Have Learned So Far
1. Board Representation and Move Generation:-
I am using the Disservin Chess Library, which provides:
   1) Efficient board representation
   2) Accurate move generation
   3) Piece tracking
   4) Utilities for board evaluation

2. Zobrist Hashing and Transposition Table
I learned how to use Zobrist hashing to generate a unique 64-bit (or 128-bit) key for each board position. This enables:
   1) Fast state comparison
   2) Efficient storage in a transposition table
The transposition table allows the engine to avoid recalculating positions it has already analyzed, significantly improving speed and performance.

3. Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Heuristics
I studied and implemented:
   1) Minimax algorithm for decision-making through game-tree search
   2) Alpha-beta pruning to eliminate unpromising branches, thus reducing computation
   3) Heuristic evaluation functions to assess non-terminal positions
   4) Depth-first search traversal for efficient search
These techniques collectively form the decision-making core of the engine.

ðŸš€ Future Plans
1. Optimizations and Speed Improvements
I plan to further optimize the engine by reducing unnecessary computations using:
   1) Parallelization/multithreading (if needed)

3. NNUE Integration
I aim to implement NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Network Evaluation), inspired by modern engines like Stockfish. NNUE will:
   1) Replace or augment heuristic evaluation
   2) Be trained on position-score pairs to evaluate positions more accurately

4. Reinforcement Learning
I plan to explore Reinforcement Learning methods such as:
   1) Q-Learning
   2) Self-play to iteratively improve evaluation
